# Session & Journal Summarizer

Part of the **mindwork** suite. Condenses sessions and journals into digestible formats for quick reference and sharing.

## What It Does

1. **Condenses** content to requested length
2. **Tailors** output for different audiences
3. **Extracts** action items and highlights
4. **Prepares** you for upcoming sessions

## Key Difference from Analyze

| Skill | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `analyze` | Deep dive - WHY and HOW | Patterns, themes, insights |
| `summary` | Quick reference - WHAT | Condensed key points |

**Summary gives you the "what happened", analyze gives you the "what it means".**

## Output Location

Summaries can be:
1. **Returned directly** (default) - displayed in conversation
2. **Saved to file** - when user specifies

If saving, use `summaries/` folder:
- `summaries/2024-01-15-session-summary.md`
- `summaries/2024-01-therapist-update.md`
- `summaries/2024-01-highlights.md`

## Notes

### Privacy Considerations

**For sharing summaries:**
- Ask before including specific details
- Default to less detail when in doubt
- Never include therapist's direct guidance without consent

### Combining with Other Skills

Summary works well after other skills:
- After `analyze`: "Now give me a one-liner"
- After `progress`: "Summarize the key trends"
- With `insights`: "Summarize my profile for sharing"

### Length Detection

If user doesn't specify length, infer from context:
- "Quick summary" → paragraph
- "Full summary" → full page
- "What happened?" → paragraph
- "Detailed summary" → full page
