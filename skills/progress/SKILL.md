# Progress Tracker

Part of the **mindwork** suite. Tracks changes over time, compares sessions, and measures progress toward therapy goals.

## What It Does

1. **Reads** analysis files from the analysis/ folder
2. **Aggregates** patterns, themes, and metrics across sessions
3. **Tracks** changes and trends over time
4. **Compares** sessions to highlight growth
5. **Measures** progress toward user-defined goals
6. **Generates** comprehensive progress reports

## Key Difference from Analyze

| Skill | Focus | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Analyze** | Single session snapshot | 1 file | Detailed analysis |
| **Progress** | Changes over time | Multiple files | Trend reports |

---

## Modes of Operation

### 1. Trend Tracking

Track how specific patterns change over time.

**Example prompts:**
> "Track my anxiety levels over the past month"
> "How has my use of catastrophizing changed?"
> "Show me the trend of my emotional themes"
> "What patterns have decreased since I started therapy?"

**Workflow:**
1. Read all analysis files from analysis/ folder
2. Extract mentions of the specified pattern/theme
3. Count occurrences per session/week/month
4. Generate timeline showing trend

### 2. Session Comparison

Compare two or more specific sessions side-by-side.

**Example prompts:**
> "Compare my first session with my most recent one"
> "Compare sessions from January vs March"
> "What's different between session 5 and session 10?"

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the sessions to compare
2. Read both analysis files
3. Extract key metrics from each
4. Generate comparison highlighting differences

### 3. Period Summaries

Generate progress reports for time periods.

**Example prompts:**
> "Generate a weekly progress report"
> "Monthly summary of my therapy progress"
> "Quarterly review of my journal reflections"
> "Summarize my progress this year"

**Workflow:**
1. Determine date range from request
2. Read all analysis files in that range
3. Aggregate metrics and extract highlights
4. Generate comprehensive report

### 4. Goal Tracking

Track progress toward user-defined goals.

**Example prompts:**
> "How am I progressing on my goals?"
> "Update my goal progress"
> "Show progress on my anxiety goal"

**Workflow:**
1. Read goals.md from vault root
2. Read recent analysis files
3. Find evidence related to each goal
4. Generate goal progress report

## Prerequisites

- Analysis files in the analysis/ folder (created by the `analyze` skill)
- Optional: `goals.md` file in vault root for goal tracking
- Optional: `mindwork.yaml` configuration

## Data Sources

### Analysis Files

The progress skill reads from analysis files created by the `analyze` skill. It extracts:

**From "Cognitive Patterns Observed" section:**
- Pattern names (e.g., "Catastrophizing", "All-or-nothing")
- Frequency of each pattern

**From "Emotional Themes" section:**
- Primary emotions mentioned
- Triggers identified

**From "Key Insights" section:**
- Breakthroughs and realizations
- Growth markers

**From "Progress Notes" section:**
- Changes noted from previous sessions
- Recurring themes

### Goals File

If present, read `goals.md` from the vault root. Parse the structure:

```markdown
# My Therapy Goals

## Active Goals

### 1. Goal Title
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Target**: What success looks like
- **Success criteria**: Measurable indicators

## Completed Goals

### Goal Title
- **Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Outcome**: What was achieved
```

**Progress**: {X}% toward target

### Evidence of Progress
- {Specific evidence from sessions}
- {Metric or observation}

### Recent Examples

## Metric Extraction Guide

When reading analysis files, extract metrics as follows:

### Counting Cognitive Patterns

Look for the "Cognitive Patterns Observed" section. Count each pattern mentioned:
- If pattern has "Frequency: recurring" or multiple evidence items → count as 2+
- Otherwise → count as 1

### Tracking Emotional Themes

Look for the "Emotional Themes" section:
- Extract primary emotions listed
- Note any intensity indicators (words like "intense", "mild", "overwhelming")

### Identifying Breakthroughs

Look for indicators of progress:
- "First time..." statements
- "Successfully..." statements
- "Recognized..." statements
- Items in "Key Insights" that show new understanding
- Positive changes noted in "Progress Notes"

### Detecting Trends

Compare metrics across chronological sessions:
- **Improving**: Pattern count decreasing OR positive emotions increasing
- **Stable**: Minimal change (±10%)
- **Needs attention**: Pattern count increasing OR negative emotions intensifying

## Notes

### Handling Missing Data

If no analysis files exist:
- Suggest running the `analyze` skill first
- Offer to analyze raw transcripts/journals directly

If goals.md doesn't exist:
- Skip goal tracking section
- Suggest creating a goals file

### Privacy

Progress reports contain aggregated personal insights. Store securely alongside analysis files.

### Interpretation Guidance

When presenting progress:
- Focus on observable changes, not judgments
- Use encouraging but realistic language
- Note that progress isn't always linear
- Celebrate small wins while acknowledging ongoing challenges
