## Coping Strategies That Work

1. **Box breathing** - Especially effective for acute anxiety before meetings
2. **Journaling before difficult conversations** - Helps clarify thoughts and needs
3. **Walking** - Movement helps process emotions and gain perspective
4. **"What would I tell a friend?"** - Effective reframing technique for self-criticism
5. **Naming the pattern** - Saying "I'm catastrophizing" reduces its power
6. **Scheduled worry time** - Contains anxiety to designated periods

- Difficulty asking for help or admitting struggle
- Improving: more honest about capacity

### With Self
